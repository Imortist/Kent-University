Task 1: 
Black box function that takes 20 real-valued numbers as input. The function has a unique
minimum fitness of 0 for a specific input. Write a genetic algorithm to find the min value.
Minimum value bound: -5.0 to 5.0

Task 2:
Knapsack problem. You have 100 items that you would like to take with you. Each item has a 
utility value and a weight(kg). You want to maximise the utility (sum of utilities of all
the items you take with you) but you are not allowed to pack more than 500kg of weight all
together.
The knapsack problem is already implemented.
Write genetic algorithm to find the combination of items to pack that maximises utility while staying within the 
weights constraints.
