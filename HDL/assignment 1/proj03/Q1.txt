Q:  How many DFF gates are in a RAM16K? 
	[I will assume your RAM16K is using exactly the necessary number of gates, 
		no more and no less. So if you think your solution might be wrong or have 
			extraneous gates, answer based on how an ideal solution ‘should’ work.]
A: Ram16k uses 4xRAM4k which uses 8xRAM512 which uses 8xRAM64, which uses 8xRAM8 which uses 8xDFFs. Adding all together we get 16,384 DFFs.
