At 200 MHz CPU can execute 200,000 cycles per milisecond;
5ms keypress means that there are 1,000,000 cycles during the keypress;
After detecting input, we have at most 1 million instructions, but there is no guarantee that we've detected input as soon as it was pressed.
If we allow 999,999 instructions after we've detected input, we will detect next input.
